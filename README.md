# Glace Base | Garry's Mod Fake Clients

What is Glace Base? Glace Base is a base designed to make the creation of Fake Clients to be easier and have the same general workflow as making Nextbots. The hardest part of Fake Clients are handled by the Base allowing you to mainly worry on the AI of your Fake Client. 

Glace Base features functions that Nextbots have by default and many other custom functions to add on.

Glace Base by default includes bots for the gamemode Murder and a test bot for showing how the process of making Fake Clients with Glace Base is done.

I tried my best to make the code clean, readable, and easy to work with.
